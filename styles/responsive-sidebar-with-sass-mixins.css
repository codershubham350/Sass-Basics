/* "@content" is a simple way to reduce the repetitive code lines
and allows an easier way for reusing and applying the changes throughout
the codebase.

"@content" rule is mostly used in media queries and keyframes.
By using this rule we can set any properties and as many as we want for the media rule.
It is going to set those properties inside, without any clutter.
