    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This
        article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.
        As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are
        styled, laid out, etc.
        <br/>
        A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you
        may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
        
        Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome,
        or Edge, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, or printer.
