Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets -> Sass (Platform independent CSS preprocessor language)

Sass is necessary because:
-> Same properties with same values can be defined with variables in Sass.
        - Includes Variables.
        - Includes Nesting.
        - Includes Mixins.
        - Includes Inheritance.
        - Includes Operators.
        - Includes Partials.
        - Includes @rules.
        and many more...

Sass is considered to be as Advanced CSS.
Sass provides dynamic programming syntax which gets compiled in normal CSS.
Sass can be defined using ".sass" or ".scss" extensions.
        - In .sass the code is written withot ';' and "{}".
        - In .scss the code is written with both ';' and "{}".

Sass is required for wriring a clean code which is easy to understand & less CSS in a programming
construct. It contains fewer code lines, is more powerful and stable, as it is an extension of CSS,
making it efficient and quick for designing & development.
